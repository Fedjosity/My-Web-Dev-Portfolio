# Getting Started with Next.js 14

## Introduction

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features that make building modern web applications even more powerful and efficient. In this post, we'll explore the key improvements and how to leverage them in your projects.

## Key Features

### App Router

The **App Router** is the new recommended routing system that provides:

- **File-based routing** with improved conventions
- **Server Components** by default for better performance
- **Nested layouts** for better code organization
- **Streaming** for faster page loads

### Server Components

Server Components allow you to:

- Run code on the server only
- Reduce client-side JavaScript
- Access backend resources directly
- Improve SEO and performance

## Code Examples

Here's a simple example of a Server Component:

```javascript
// app/page.tsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Hello, Next.js 14!</h1>
      <p>Data: {data.message}</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

When working with Next.js 14, consider these best practices:

1. **Use Server Components** by default
2. **Implement proper error boundaries**
3. **Optimize images** with the Image component
4. **Leverage streaming** for better UX

### Performance Tips

- Use `loading="lazy"` for images below the fold
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Use the built-in performance tools

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 represents a significant step forward in the React ecosystem. The new features make it easier to build fast, scalable applications while maintaining excellent developer experience.
